		<h4>Here you can download the latest and former versions, and you can also download Flash Player Standalone and other infos in REQUIREMENTS and in DISCLAIMER sessions below.</h4>
		<br/>Please pay attention that I usually update it more often in the <a href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=2265" target="_blank">LOK site!</a>
		<br/>ATTENTION: If you're having the 'GAME SLOT saving/loading problem', where you lose the current princess stats (say, slot2 with Rosalina making slot1 also with Rosalina instead of Fire Peach), please use Flash Player 25. Also check if your browser is using version 25 or the latest one. This is a FLASH PLAYER problem, not a GAME BUG. You can also use the Clipboard save (so you wont lose those problems in former versions of Flash!)
		<br/>If you have errors downloading, like 'invalid key', please use another browser. Firefox sometimes has problems when clicking below!

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">LATEST CHANGELOGs:</span></h3>
			<b>Update 3.32 (29th April 2017) - SERVICE FIXES (Flash Player 25 or later recommended!)</b>
			<br/>- IMPROVED Princess pose code. Less CPU usage! (You can notice in DEBUG screen: Zero EP Listeners most of the time!) But tests still being made. Some glitches are expected, like the princess not losing/dressing a crown or part of her clothing until some seconds later or when you change her pose (like walking). If this happens, please create an issue in my GITHUB or just notice me in LOK site.
			<br/>- Rule Change: The princess wont die from Yux rings in 9-1 level. Thats because this level wasnt made for the princess to lose a life. She is captive, but the level is itself 'secure' enough for her.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess was regaining her garters and stockings (what?) after certain scenes. Tech info:  'frame 0 STOP! instead of 4' (F0SI4 or 'FOSIA') syndrome.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: 2 strange 'yellow block with eyes' in Peach's castle. Actually they were leftovers of my several tests to fix certain bugs with them.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: In 9-1, the princess was not getting invisible after taking the right tube combinations in the concoctionator room.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: In 9-1, Sir Grodus was not talking when Peach used the TEC cable.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: when the princess crushed brown blocks without nothing in it (no coins, etc), there is no animation or sound anymore. They just disappear.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: when the princess is invisible, at some animations (like jumping), strange blue hands appear in.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Frog walk/hopping animation weren't 'going on' (she only do it once), so that we have to push the arrow key again and again (Tech info: gravity when touching the ground interfering with poses (going to 'standing frog' instead of remaining 'walking frog' when LEFT or RIGHT remained pressed. The code was remade).
			<br/><br/>
			<b>Update 3.31 (25th April 2017) - IN PROGRESS</b>
			<br/>- Please reload an external XML (english or other) to refresh the language of the game! Use the ones in my <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT/" target="_blank">GITHUB</a>. Or you can just click RESET SAVES in the first screen if you dont have saved games and you dont want to mess around the XML files (English only!)
			<br/>- NEW: DoopLiss creature! For now, he will inhabit the ghost castle. But he will only appear in certain days. A tip to see him more often is to detect the pattern of the day. (For example, perhaps he appears in each 4 days). You can talk to him, but no scenes yet!
			<br/>- NEW: 'Mario?' scene. I wont say what he will really do. The princess can find him in a random level of world 7 and in 8-2. A tip: he usually appears in a forest/grassy area. He's also in the gallery.
			<br/>- NEW: Peach and Blooper Gangbang art by TripFlip! To unlock it, just fuck all of Bloopers (Squids) unicque scenes.
			<br/>- Rule Change: MIPS (the rabbit) will appear in more areas of the game. He prefers underground areas.
			<br/>- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, 50% of 1up mushrooms will be Poison mushrooms instead. It's a random occurrence, so when you punch three 1up blocks in your journey, you may find 1up three times in a row, then poison four times, then 1up just one time, then a poison, etc (it's unpredictable).
			<br/>- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, pregnancy will happen more often, even if you configure it as 'LOW' in the options. But if you choose NONE, of course she wont get pregnant even in HARD mode.
			<br/>- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, the princess will be a nymph of the level after 8 scenes instead of 10, and a nymph of the game after 60 scenes instead of 80.
			<br/>- Added the current game version info in Debug screen (when you press PAGE DOWN key), just to ease my job when people help me find the bugs.
			<br/>- BUG FIX: When the princess used a bomb to explode the rocks (levels like 3-1), she was locking herself up. And sometimes, the rocks werent exploding normally.
			<br/>- BUG FIX: Creatures freezing when touching the princess when she has a chainball. Instead of fucking her, they stopped working.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Adjusted blue 'descent' text (It was too stretched horizontally)
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: When the princess is in a scene with another female like Chompette or Toadella, she wont say something like 'Wow! What a dick!' and 'Ohhh he doesn't stop cumming!' anymore.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: When going to the prologues screen until reaching the train one, both the train music and 'happy mushroom' music were playing at the same time.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Level 9-1 (X-naut base) not playing in the beginning (the player needed to press / button to restart the sound/music)
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Certain princess hands were with a wrong color.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: The LEVEL names (when you change the translation to another language) remained English. The problem happened because 'variables' file (even in Flags file) loaded BEFORE the XML file was read (I dont know why). So I created a function that returns the current level/world name, going to the current XML. 
			<br/><br/>
			<b>Update 3.30 (1st April 2017)</b>
			<br/>- NEW: Flurry scene 5 (By Blargh!) Its put in scene 4, so scene 5 will be the vaginal one (more time for Peach to remain virgin).
			<br/>- NEW: Revamped 'underground rock' by Biles! Its those brown rocks in certain levels like 1-3 (underground area).
			<br/>- RULE CHANGED: 'main cheat' activate key is now '1 and 0' instead of 1,9 and 0 pressed at the same time, due to some requests (people using certain keyboards and notebooks with problems like 3 or more keys pressed at the same time).
			<br/>- CHANGED: instead of a 'red circle' near to her portrait when there is a bug in the game, the name BUG will appear there instead.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Fire Peach with 'endless growing blue earrings' when taking a Fire Powerup while a normal Peach.
		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">REQUIREMENTS:</span></h3>
		<p>- <b>A faster processor</b> (Pentium Core 2 Duo or higher recommended) . You can surely play it in slower PCs and even mobile phones but you will need to tweak graphic settings (OPTIONS SCREEN in the game), or even overclock your device. The game relies more on CPU speed (MHZ/GHZ) than GPU, as Flash uses almost 100% of its code in CPU.</p>
		<p>- <b>Flash Player 12 up to 25</b> (The recommended version is 25). Faster versions is 12, 17 or 21, but be careful about those versions (due to SAVE/LOAD slot bug). You can get Flash versions (standalone player) BELOW!

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>. Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separatelly (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out 'KNOWN BUGS' section below before reporting.		
			<br/></br><b>I wont make:</b>
			  <br/>- Scat. I am not fond of these fetishes, but I do know people who like it, and I dont care anyway, more because ON/OFF option was possible. However, too many people are against this at all costs, so it wont be coded in MIM PUT in any circunstances. Moreover, Peach is a 'clean' damsel, outside and inside (a perfect woman for ass lovers). However, a 'clean cum fart' (e.g. for her ass/pussy) is feasible.
			  <br/>- Theatre/Audience style 'fight' like Paper Mario 2: I wont make this system neither on PUT or in Cute Peach game. Fights will happen during normal level, right on the spot (scenes). But we could have creatures that can make a crowd there in certain circunstances. And we can have a theatre AREA with an audience but inside a given building, with some local fights there. Sorry about that but I dont like the threatre system in Paper Mario 2.
			  <br/>- Modern electronic objects found in real life, like palmtops, portable consoles, cameras for Lakitu and Wario, cars and motorcycles. This game follows a medieval theme, like Super Mario 1, 2, and Super Mario RPG. They can have classical/magical structures instead, like wooden binoculars and carriages. If modern karts/bikes are present, it should be explict they were E.Gadd or Sir Grodus technology. Sorry about that, I just dont agree of *everything* in a Mario game. The 'non-linear timescale' every Mario game has was the way Mario creators did to give more fun for kids. 
			  <br/>- Certain Mario friends/enemies from newer games like New Super Mario Bros (U) and Super Paper Mario (mostly the unknown ones, not common in older series), and Waluigi (in the case I add Wario). So I wont be just adding friends/enemies until further discussion. People have really to convince me and better if you bring the model with some scenes already, like LuftMallow did with the Anuboo (the black dog from Super Star Saga). The exception is creatures from Paper Mario 2, because I based this game on it too.
			  <br/>- Non Mario Universe creatures like Donkey Kong, Zelda, Pokemon... The only exception is the DK himself ONLY in the case I add a Pauline scene, this being an Easter Egg.
			<br/><br/>Just to remember, I already discussed about these items during these forum pages.
