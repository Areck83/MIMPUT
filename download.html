		<br/>- Version 3.30 <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!J4dXwZ7Q!k0I90h5jG-YXZKSi-AO1xGmHo5c_DS8sijVEE8f-wcA" target="_blank">here!</a>

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">LATEST CHANGELOGs:</span></h3>
			<b>Update 3.30 (1st April 2017) - IN PROGRESS</b>
			<br/>- Please reload an external XML (english or other) to refresh the language of the game! Use the ones in my GITHUB (https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT/). Or you can just click RESET SAVES in the first screen if you dont have saved games and you dont want to mess around the XML files (English only!)
			<br/>- NEW: Flurry scene 5 (By Blargh!) Its put in scene 4, so scene 5 will be the vaginal one (more time for Peach to remain virgin).
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Fire Peach with 'endless growing blue earrings' when taking a Fire Powerup while a normal Peach.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: BluePrint in 7-1 was impossible to take (a given pipe was not being accessible).
			<br/>- Rule Change: 'main cheat' activate key is now '1 and 0' instead of 1,9 and 0 pressed at the same time, due to some requests (people using certain keyboards and notebooks with problems like 3 or more keys pressed at the same time).
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Update 3.29 (3rd March 2017)</b>
			<br/>- NEW: Fire Peach PS character (due to some requests)!
			<br/>- NEW: OPTION: "Fire Peach if burned, back to Peach if lost". It will be ON as default. If 'Vanilla Peach' takes a Fire Flower powerup or if she is touched by a fire hazard/creature, she will be with a dark skin. She will be normal again if you take another powerup or lose a life. It will only work if you're using a 'Peach' character. You can disable this feature in the options screen (it will be saved in the cache for new games as well).
			<br/>- IMPROVED protection modes! Protection is the 'invulnerability time after being hit or a scene'. Now you can choose between 3,2,1 or 0 seconds! Beware that HARD GAME mode ignores this (Its always '0'!) Default: 3 seconds.
			<br/>- IMPROVED code of Character Select Screen (tech info: target button instead of older 'a listener for each button').
			<br/>- IMPROVED intro/prologue screens with NEW screens! Now, the first screen tells us that everything was in peace in the princess's castle, then it will show us that the current character (be it Peach, Daisy, Rosalina, etc) was playing with the toads (some in a lewd way), explaining why the innocent princess is already experiencing lascivous actions, then the train scene, and finally the drama of airships invading. Morever, even if you're playing as Daisy or Krystal, for example, the story will tell you were in castle with the toads, etc, as its supposed that each princess know Peach's castle already.
			<br/>- RULE CHANGED: now, all 4 toads will be seated in her royal table (in her castle level) in certain days (Day 5, Day 15...), alongside the current probability to appear in any other day (you can still see them seated there on day 2 and day 8, for example, although much rarer). Before this update, it was hard to get them all seated (probability < 5%).
			<br/>- RULE CHANGED: the princess wont be taken by a creature right after using the blue info/sound boxes. Some invulnerability will be applied for enough time to run away.
			<br/>- RULE CHANGED: When restarting the game, the train and bed scenes in the prologue will now make the princess wear (or not) the garter/stockings/gloves, etc, that was configured in her outfit screen for new powerups.
			<br/>- BUG FIX: Peach's Bath scenes (like in her castle) are now DISABLED until I fix it.
			<br/>- BUG FIX: Lakitu pole scene (when the princess touches the dildo) made her disappear. Tech Info: Argument error (this,0)
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: In the train scenes (like in the prologue and when you walk around in this level with Mario), the mountain were only moving once (then we werent seeing any mountain again). Also, the upper are of the train was blue instead of black (it was like the roof was absent or destroyed).
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Certain powerups set with 'random outfit' (like Striker) was making other powerups like Fire Flower also be random.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: wrong balloon text in the cumming action of 'curious restrain' scene (next to Leslie the swan) in her castle.
		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">REQUIREMENTS:</span></h3>
		<p>- <b>A faster processor</b> (Pentium Core 2 Duo or higher recommended) . You can surely play it in slower PCs and even mobile phones but you will need to tweak graphic settings (OPTIONS SCREEN in the game), or even overclock your device. The game relies more on CPU speed (MHZ/GHZ) than GPU, as Flash uses almost 100% of its code in CPU.</p>
		<p>- <b>Flash Player 12 up to 25</b> (The best version would be 12 or 21): You can get Flash versions (standalone player) BELOW!
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 12 <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!UwM23aIS!Y2qMgKulwHOB1lxZLb3-OsKl3E-shsMMg-zCsAw3-PU" target="_blank">here!</a>

		<br />LINUX VERSION <a class="postlink" href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=31899" target="_blank">HERE!</a> <br />-&gt; Or just use Flash Player already in your current browser (provided its not version 20 due to bugs!)</p>
		<p>-You can play this game with a XBOX360, PS2 or other USB controller! This requires <a class="postlink" href="http://xpadder.com" target="_blank">XPadder</a>. More instructions <a class="postlink" href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=2265&amp;start=14960#p538323" target="_blank">here</a> and a great post about a profile that doesn't require a mouse <a class="postlink" href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=2265&amp;p=595070#p595540" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>. Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separatelly (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out 'KNOWN BUGS' section below before reporting.		
			<br/></br><b>I wont make:</b>
			  <br/>- Scat. I am not fond of these fetishes, but I do know people who like it, and I dont care anyway, more because ON/OFF option was possible. However, too many people are against this at all costs, so it wont be coded in MIM PUT in any circunstances. Moreover, Peach is a 'clean' damsel, outside and inside (a perfect woman for ass lovers). However, a 'clean cum fart' (e.g. for her ass/pussy) is feasible.
			  <br/>- Theatre/Audience style 'fight' like Paper Mario 2: I wont make this system neither on PUT or in Cute Peach game. Fights will happen during normal level, right on the spot (scenes). But we could have creatures that can make a crowd there in certain circunstances. And we can have a theatre AREA with an audience but inside a given building, with some local fights there. Sorry about that but I dont like the threatre system in Paper Mario 2.
			  <br/>- Modern electronic objects found in real life, like palmtops, portable consoles, cameras for Lakitu and Wario, cars and motorcycles. This game follows a medieval theme, like Super Mario 1, 2, and Super Mario RPG. They can have classical/magical structures instead, like wooden binoculars and carriages. If modern karts/bikes are present, it should be explict they were E.Gadd or Sir Grodus technology. Sorry about that, I just dont agree of *everything* in a Mario game. The 'non-linear timescale' every Mario game has was the way Mario creators did to give more fun for kids. 
			  <br/>- Certain Mario friends/enemies from newer games like New Super Mario Bros (U) and Super Paper Mario (mostly the unknown ones, not common in older series), and Waluigi (in the case I add Wario). So I wont be just adding friends/enemies until further discussion. People have really to convince me and better if you bring the model with some scenes already, like LuftMallow did with the Anuboo (the black dog from Super Star Saga). The exception is creatures from Paper Mario 2, because I based this game on it too.
			  <br/>- Non Mario Universe creatures like Donkey Kong, Zelda, Pokemon... The only exception is the DK himself ONLY in the case I add a Pauline scene, this being an Easter Egg.
			<br/><br/>Just to remember, I already discussed about these items during these forum pages.
