		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">REQUIREMENTS:</span></h3>
		<p>- <b>A faster processor</b> (Pentium Core 2 Duo or higher recommended) . You can surely play it in slower PCs and even mobile phones but you will need to tweak graphic settings (OPTIONS SCREEN in the game), or even overclock your device. The game relies more on CPU speed (MHZ/GHZ) than GPU, as Flash uses almost 100% of its code in CPU.</p>
		<p>- <b>Flash Player 12 up to 25</b> (The best version would be 12 or 21): You can get Flash versions (standalone player) BELOW!
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 12 <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!UwM23aIS!Y2qMgKulwHOB1lxZLb3-OsKl3E-shsMMg-zCsAw3-PU" target="_blank">here!</a>
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 12 (DEBUG player) <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!xsFlzBDD!EXv47RJQzroZpgY1rFDNAnVYJn52JVVwhct18L1npWw" target="_blank">here!</a>
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 21 <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!N1sGRLRa!LK9me09jGJURLVlCDqu5DJ4PPY3xAzY5CS6pEoY8mbk" target="_blank">here!</a>
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 21 (DEBUG player) <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!Fk9CSaRR!SfQP3v9ZMRL2ec-TzIv6ecv4O_pZthSxoRIzZt7zVH4" target="_blank">here!</a>
		<br />LINUX VERSION <a class="postlink" href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=31899" target="_blank">HERE!</a> <br />-&gt; Or just use Flash Player already in your current browser (provided its not version 20 due to bugs!)</p>
		<p>-You can play this game with a XBOX360, PS2 or other USB controller! This requires <a class="postlink" href="http://xpadder.com" target="_blank">XPadder</a>. More instructions <a class="postlink" href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=2265&amp;start=14960#p538323" target="_blank">here</a> and a great post about a profile that doesn't require a mouse <a class="postlink" href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=2265&amp;p=595070#p595540" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>. Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separatelly (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out 'KNOWN BUGS' section below before reporting.		
			<br/></br><b>I wont make:</b>
			  <br/>- Scat. I am not fond of these fetishes, but I do know people who like it, and I dont care anyway, more because ON/OFF option was possible. However, too many people are against this at all costs, so it wont be coded in MIM PUT in any circunstances. Moreover, Peach is a 'clean' damsel, outside and inside (a perfect woman for ass lovers). However, a 'clean cum fart' (e.g. for her ass/pussy) is feasible.
			  <br/>- Theatre/Audience style 'fight' like Paper Mario 2: I wont make this system neither on PUT or in Cute Peach game. Fights will happen during normal level, right on the spot (scenes). But we could have creatures that can make a crowd there in certain circunstances. And we can have a theatre AREA with an audience but inside a given building, with some local fights there. Sorry about that but I dont like the threatre system in Paper Mario 2.
			  <br/>- Modern electronic objects found in real life, like palmtops, portable consoles, cameras for Lakitu and Wario, cars and motorcycles. This game follows a medieval theme, like Super Mario 1, 2, and Super Mario RPG. They can have classical/magical structures instead, like wooden binoculars and carriages. If modern karts/bikes are present, it should be explict they were E.Gadd or Sir Grodus technology. Sorry about that, I just dont agree of *everything* in a Mario game. The 'non-linear timescale' every Mario game has was the way Mario creators did to give more fun for kids. 
			  <br/>- Certain Mario friends/enemies from newer games like New Super Mario Bros (U) and Super Paper Mario (mostly the unknown ones, not common in older series), and Waluigi (in the case I add Wario). So I wont be just adding friends/enemies until further discussion. People have really to convince me and better if you bring the model with some scenes already, like LuftMallow did with the Anuboo (the black dog from Super Star Saga). The exception is creatures from Paper Mario 2, because I based this game on it too.
			  <br/>- Non Mario Universe creatures like Donkey Kong, Zelda, Pokemon... The only exception is the DK himself ONLY in the case I add a Pauline scene, this being an Easter Egg.
			<br/><br/>Just to remember, I already discussed about these items during these forum pages.
