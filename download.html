		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">LATEST CHANGELOGs:</span></h3>
			<b>Update 3.31 (21th April 2017) - IN PROGRESS</b>
			<br/>- Please reload an external XML (english or other) to refresh the language of the game! Use the ones in my GITHUB (https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT/). Or you can just click RESET SAVES in the first screen if you dont have saved games and you dont want to mess around the XML files (English only!)
			<br/>- NEW: DoopLiss creature! For now, he will inhabit the ghost castle. But he will only appear in certain days. A tip to see him more often is to detect the pattern of the day. (For example, perhaps he appears in each 4 days). You can talk to him, but no scenes yet!
			<br/>- NEW: 'Mario?' scene. I wont say what he will really do. The princess can find him in a random level of world 7 and in 8-2. A tip: he usually appears in a forest/grassy area. He's also in the gallery.
			<br/>- NEW: Peach and Blooper Gangbang art by TripFlip! To unlock it, just fuck all of Bloopers (Squids) unicque scenes.
			<br/>- Rule Change: MIPS (the rabbit) will appear in more areas of the game. He prefers underground areas.
			<br/>- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, 50% of 1up mushrooms will be Poison mushrooms instead. It's a random occurrence, so when you punch three 1up blocks in your journey, you may find 1up three times in a row, then poison four times, then 1up just one time, then a poison, etc (it's unpredictable).
			<br/>- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, pregnancy will happen more often, even if you configure it as 'LOW' in the options. But if you choose NONE, of course she wont get pregnant even in HARD mode.
			<br/>- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, the princess will be a nymph of the level after 8 scenes instead of 10, and a nymph of the game after 60 scenes instead of 80.
			<br/>- Added the current game version info in Debug screen (when you press PAGE DOWN key), just to easy my job when people help me find the bugs.
			<br/>- BUG FIX: WHen the princess used a bomb to explode the rocks (levels like 3-1), she was locking herself up. And sometimes, the rocks werent exploding normally.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Adjusted blue 'descent' text (It was too stretched horizontally)
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: When the princess is in a scene with another female like Chompette or Toadella, she wont say something like 'Wow! What a dick!' and 'Ohhh he doesn't stop cumming!' anymore.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: When going to the prologues screen until reaching the train one, both the train music and 'happy mushroom' music were playing at the same time.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Level 9-1 (X-naut base) not playing in the beginning (the player needed to press / button to restart the sound/music)
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Certain princess hands were with a wrong color.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: The LEVEL names (when you change the translation to another language) remained English. The problem happened because 'variables' file (even in Flags file) loaded BEFORE the XML file was read (I dont know why). So I created a function that returns the current level/world name, going to the current XML. 
			<br/><br/>
			<b>Update 3.30 (1st April 2017)</b>
			<br/>- NEW: Flurry scene 5 (By Blargh!) Its put in scene 4, so scene 5 will be the vaginal one (more time for Peach to remain virgin).
			<br/>- NEW: Revamped 'underground rock' by Biles! Its those brown rocks in certain levels like 1-3 (underground area).
			<br/>- RULE CHANGED: 'main cheat' activate key is now '1 and 0' instead of 1,9 and 0 pressed at the same time, due to some requests (people using certain keyboards and notebooks with problems like 3 or more keys pressed at the same time).
			<br/>- CHANGED: instead of a 'red circle' near to her portrait when there is a bug in the game, the name BUG will appear there instead.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Fire Peach with 'endless growing blue earrings' when taking a Fire Powerup while a normal Peach.
		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">REQUIREMENTS:</span></h3>
		<p>- <b>A faster processor</b> (Pentium Core 2 Duo or higher recommended) . You can surely play it in slower PCs and even mobile phones but you will need to tweak graphic settings (OPTIONS SCREEN in the game), or even overclock your device. The game relies more on CPU speed (MHZ/GHZ) than GPU, as Flash uses almost 100% of its code in CPU.</p>
		<p>- <b>Flash Player 12 up to 25</b> (The best version would be 12 or 21): You can get Flash versions (standalone player) BELOW!
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 12 <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!UwM23aIS!Y2qMgKulwHOB1lxZLb3-OsKl3E-shsMMg-zCsAw3-PU" target="_blank">here!</a>
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 12 (DEBUG player) <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!xsFlzBDD!EXv47RJQzroZpgY1rFDNAnVYJn52JVVwhct18L1npWw" target="_blank">here!</a>
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 21 <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!N1sGRLRa!LK9me09jGJURLVlCDqu5DJ4PPY3xAzY5CS6pEoY8mbk" target="_blank">here!</a>
		<br />WINDOWS VERSION 21 (DEBUG player) <a class="postlink" href="https://mega.nz/#!Fk9CSaRR!SfQP3v9ZMRL2ec-TzIv6ecv4O_pZthSxoRIzZt7zVH4" target="_blank">here!</a>
		<br />LINUX VERSION <a class="postlink" href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=31899" target="_blank">HERE!</a> <br />-&gt; Or just use Flash Player already in your current browser (provided its not version 20 due to bugs!)</p>
		<p>-You can play this game with a XBOX360, PS2 or other USB controller! This requires <a class="postlink" href="http://xpadder.com" target="_blank">XPadder</a>. More instructions <a class="postlink" href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=2265&amp;start=14960#p538323" target="_blank">here</a> and a great post about a profile that doesn't require a mouse <a class="postlink" href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=2265&amp;p=595070#p595540" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>. Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separatelly (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out 'KNOWN BUGS' section below before reporting.		
			<br/></br><b>I wont make:</b>
			  <br/>- Scat. I am not fond of these fetishes, but I do know people who like it, and I dont care anyway, more because ON/OFF option was possible. However, too many people are against this at all costs, so it wont be coded in MIM PUT in any circunstances. Moreover, Peach is a 'clean' damsel, outside and inside (a perfect woman for ass lovers). However, a 'clean cum fart' (e.g. for her ass/pussy) is feasible.
			  <br/>- Theatre/Audience style 'fight' like Paper Mario 2: I wont make this system neither on PUT or in Cute Peach game. Fights will happen during normal level, right on the spot (scenes). But we could have creatures that can make a crowd there in certain circunstances. And we can have a theatre AREA with an audience but inside a given building, with some local fights there. Sorry about that but I dont like the threatre system in Paper Mario 2.
			  <br/>- Modern electronic objects found in real life, like palmtops, portable consoles, cameras for Lakitu and Wario, cars and motorcycles. This game follows a medieval theme, like Super Mario 1, 2, and Super Mario RPG. They can have classical/magical structures instead, like wooden binoculars and carriages. If modern karts/bikes are present, it should be explict they were E.Gadd or Sir Grodus technology. Sorry about that, I just dont agree of *everything* in a Mario game. The 'non-linear timescale' every Mario game has was the way Mario creators did to give more fun for kids. 
			  <br/>- Certain Mario friends/enemies from newer games like New Super Mario Bros (U) and Super Paper Mario (mostly the unknown ones, not common in older series), and Waluigi (in the case I add Wario). So I wont be just adding friends/enemies until further discussion. People have really to convince me and better if you bring the model with some scenes already, like LuftMallow did with the Anuboo (the black dog from Super Star Saga). The exception is creatures from Paper Mario 2, because I based this game on it too.
			  <br/>- Non Mario Universe creatures like Donkey Kong, Zelda, Pokemon... The only exception is the DK himself ONLY in the case I add a Pauline scene, this being an Easter Egg.
			<br/><br/>Just to remember, I already discussed about these items during these forum pages.
