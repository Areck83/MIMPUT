			<h3><span style="color: #000080;">LATEST CHANGELOGs:</span></h3>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.35 (21th May 2017)</h4>
					- Please reload an external XML (english or other) to refresh the language of the game! Use the ones in my <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT/" target="_blank">GITHUB</a>. Or you can just click RESET SAVES in the first screen if you dont have saved games and you dont want to mess around the XML files (English only!)
					<br/>- Feature: Now you can use one of the sewer pipes to go to a given world you visited at least once with the cannon. If not, the princess will just go outside (Red Pipe).
					<br/>- RULE CHANGE: in HARD GAME mode, if she has 80% or more (horniness), the princess will be dizzy for a while.
					<br/>- BUG FIX: when the princess threw a given object, like shells or a pow block in levels like 5-6, she was freezing up!
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: if 'ALWAYS A NYMPH' Personality option is set, she was still 'shaking herself with her hand in her head' when she stops walking.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when time is up, a creature was appearing all of a sudden during another creature action on the princess. Actually, the creature should only appear if the princess is 'available'.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when you set a custom DRESS Powerup in the OUTFIT screen, then you restart the game, the princess was in her bed with that outfit. Actually, the princess should be with her dress, as she returned from the train like this.
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.34 (17th May 2017)</h4>
					- NEW: Level 8-2 (underground level). It's a new themed level (it's not a level based on another). Some new textures. There are also interesting features like the rotate platforms and the crushing trunks.
					<br/>- NEW cheat codes: 'HOLD 1, then left or right' to change outfits, and 'HOLD Y, then press 3' to be pregnant. You need to activate the master cheat first (1 and 0).
					<br/>- NEW: 'Load Game' and 'Options' buttons in the intro screen!
					<br/>- ADDED Waluigi in some levels (tip: where he is, Wario might be with him or not), and if you are continuing the game (if you finished it at least once), they will appear all the time in the toad town bar. Waluigi can be in 'Smoothie Depot level too' (with Mona!) She's not a playable character yet. No Waluigi scenes yet.
					<br/>- Rule change: in skull rocks scene in 6-6 level, if the princess sucks their dicks 'in a non lewd way', it wont count as a sexual act (laid countdown). E.g. If its 48 left to be a pure nymph, it will remain as 48.
					<br/>- BUG FIX: In 6-4 level, in delfino streets, when using a given green pipe, the game was throwing the princess to a blue void area. Also, the trampoline wasn't working. Finally, the toads were going to the front of a wooden table in certain scenes.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When restarting the game in certain circunstances, odd problems happened with outfits and its current situation, like shred vagina/butt areas. Tech info: 'Flags.SAVED*' not being reset in _reset().
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When using the PANIC screen (ENTER key) if in the 'corridor pipe' area (like when using a pipe in the worldmap), the princess was reappearing in the same (or different) worldmap, but zoomed out and with some functions not working. Now she will be warped to 'peach castle campus area' if Panic Screen is used SPECIFICALLY from those specific inner level areas, as there is no way to find out which worldmap she came from (in order to return her to it).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In 6-4 level, XML fix in Pole scene.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: XML ERROR when loading ShyGuy village level in World 3.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In 6-6 level, XML fix in the Flavio dialogue.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The Princess Portrait (horny status) was something showing a wrong princess (e.g. Rosalina) than your current one (e.g. Daisy).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: XML fix in Toad (doc or fake doc) scenes: if a normal toad, the princess was saying 'Erhm...Doc...Dont you..Ahhhh... have another way...to cure it?' instead of 'Hey...you're not a doctor! Ahhh!'
					<br/>- Small enhancements like the 'smoke animation' when changing outfits.
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.33 (10th May 2017) - SERVICE FIXES II</h4>
					- ADDED Peach Pregnancy screen in the achievement screen! If you playing a 'Peach' character, and you get pregnancy for many times, you will unlock it!
					<br/>- Rule Change: when the princess is with the slave outfit, she wont lose it part by part. It's a fixed outfit until she finds another powerup or loses a life!
					<br/>- Improvement: AN OVERHAUL of SAVE/LOAD slot system using 'Multiple Save File Approach - 'MUSAFIA'. Only the first slot is compliant with the last game versions, so you need to resave in slot 2,3,4,5 in order to retain them in your system. You can keep your first saved slot and any saved text (clipboard saved to txt files), as they will work in this version. But beware! The save to clipboard will now save to an external slot (in a text file), then if you load it, it wont recover all your slots (if your game has 0 used slots, it will still be like that). So you just save the loaded game again in a given slot you want.
					<br/>- Improvement: 'tail' bodypart is now a reference to memory. No more enterframes on it.
					<br/>- Improvement: when pressing SPACE (next key) in the character select screen, you will get the current selected princess that was made by LEFT/RIGHT keys.
					<br/>- Readjusted princess size in Monty Mole scenes (she was a bit bigger).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Strange nipples appearing in her backside boobs (when they're large enough when the princess is facing backside) during scenes like SockHop (the green sack creature). Tech Info: 'noNipple' var cant be right in frame 1 of some scenes due to Timeline.exec mechanism + noMoreEnterFrames in objects.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'Toads in her table' to eat a pizza' scene: scene not happening when all toads are there due to Type Coercion error.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Luigi was not reading his book anymore
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess was walking like holding a dress, after taking up the 'naked leaf' powerup.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess (as a Fire princess) was jumping herself up when hitting a X-naut or a Chomp with a fireball.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When the princess is a raccoon and falling, she only animate her tail once.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess was able to 'lose a life' (DEL KEY) in the worldmap.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When using the cannon, the world name was still 'Mushroom Kingdom' in the MENU screen, when reaching a new worldmap, like Bumpy Forest. The player needed to enter a given level, then exit it to return to the current worldmap in order to fix the world name.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The Fire Princess (Frontside dialogue model) was not with red eyes.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Princess' earrings and crown not being removed when she undresses to take a shower. Also, she was leaving the bath stark naked, without her crown (those blue bath she can lay into (marble ones), like in Daisy palace level). Tech Info: 'noPile' returning without executing important functions.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: Princess' scene with another princess (like Peach and Daisy) showing wrong hands (e.g. Daisy with a wrong Fire Peach hand).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: Princess' scene with another princess (like Peach and Daisy) making the other princess with the same eye color/style as the main character
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: When Daisy was masturbating, the playable princess' horny bar was going up without the player consent.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): strange 'green pipe inside another pipe' in the big upside down pipe in the sewers area of Peach's castle. (Tech info: pipe.init() happens after _level config, so we moved to pos-init).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): when the princess used one of the 8 pipes in the bottom, we couldnt use CTRL do go to the menu (strange message: "Can't go to the pause screen while entering doors or objects!")  (Tech Info: wrong 'destination="pipe_out1" which is non existant)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): when we pressed LEFT or RIGHT right after the princess returned from the sewer level (a pipe from a given worldmap, like SubCon), the level ends unexpectelly (Tech Info: Fallingpalacemaneuver_4104/frame66()[MarioisMissingPUT_fla.PZz_fallingpalacemaneuver_4104::frame66:4] still being called! Its like when finishing another airship, when returning to the sewers, the airship1 over Peach castle was making her fall that way - message Level 1-1: Config.finishedWorld is true, this happens when Peach beaten the airship some seconds before!). But THIS CAN HAPPEN when Peach returned to worldmap 3, then returned to the sewers much later!)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Princess' Castle level: XML Error when 'talking' with the chains in her tower, and when trying to use the teleporter in 9-1 level
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 9-1 level: XML Error when trying to use the teleporter
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 4-4 level (Boggly Tree): XML Error when talking to the Puny Elder
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In Toad Town, when asking Charlieton to buy something, if you do it, the coins decreases for the HUD, but slowly enough to make Charlieton say 'You dont have enough coins'. Now, you will only be able to press a given number in the dialogue if all coins were removed from the princess 'purse' (her asshole). Also, the 'coin number' animation will be smoother.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: XML Error when trying to get 'YourCumWasCleaned' message.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Princess' Castle level: The princess butt is appearing in certain short skirts in the 'side throne' scene (next to her royal table)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The 'Train' occurrence that the princess wrote in her diary is being kept in the diary BEFORE the Toadsworth event.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess' eyes (Frontside dialogue model) was not red when the princess is a fire princess.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The female princesses that are friend of Peach (like Daisy and the Shygirl) is with red eyes when you are playing a Fire Peach character.

You can surely play it in slower PCs and even mobile phones but you will need to tweak graphic settings (OPTIONS SCREEN in the game), or even overclock your device.

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>. Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separatelly (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out 'KNOWN BUGS' section below before reporting.		
			<br/></br><b>I wont make:</b>
			  <br/>- Scat. I am not fond of these fetishes, but I do know people who like it, and I dont care anyway, more because ON/OFF option was possible. However, too many people are against this at all costs, so it wont be coded in MIM PUT in any circunstances. Moreover, Peach is a 'clean' damsel, outside and inside (a perfect woman for ass lovers). However, a 'clean cum fart' (e.g. for her ass/pussy) is feasible.
			  <br/>- Theatre/Audience style 'fight' like Paper Mario 2: I wont make this system neither on PUT or in Cute Peach game. Fights will happen during normal level, right on the spot (scenes). But we could have creatures that can make a crowd there in certain circunstances. And we can have a theatre AREA with an audience but inside a given building, with some local fights there. Sorry about that but I dont like the threatre system in Paper Mario 2.
			  <br/>- Modern electronic objects found in real life, like palmtops, portable consoles, cameras for Lakitu and Wario, cars and motorcycles. This game follows a medieval theme, like Super Mario 1, 2, and Super Mario RPG. They can have classical/magical structures instead, like wooden binoculars and carriages. If modern karts/bikes are present, it should be explict they were E.Gadd or Sir Grodus technology. Sorry about that, I just dont agree of *everything* in a Mario game. The 'non-linear timescale' every Mario game has was the way Mario creators did to give more fun for kids. 
			  <br/>- Certain Mario friends/enemies from newer games like New Super Mario Bros (U) and Super Paper Mario (mostly the unknown ones, not common in older series), and Waluigi (in the case I add Wario). So I wont be just adding friends/enemies until further discussion. People have really to convince me and better if you bring the model with some scenes already, like LuftMallow did with the Anuboo (the black dog from Super Star Saga). The exception is creatures from Paper Mario 2, because I based this game on it too.
			  <br/>- Non Mario Universe creatures like Donkey Kong, Zelda, Pokemon... The only exception is the DK himself ONLY in the case I add a Pauline scene, this being an Easter Egg.
			<br/><br/>Just to remember, I already discussed about these items during these forum pages.
