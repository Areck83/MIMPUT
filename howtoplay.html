		<h3>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:</h3>
			-Peach can fuck enemies in order to laid them. Enemies so known in Mario World. Now they will be so happy. She can kill/put some to sleep, in order to try to remain virgin. All for freeing up her county from koopalings. Random things can occur and Peach is able to earn coins and points. Peach can be punished (like losing a life or having to fuck more) if she forgot to do some of her holes (whops, I mean roles!)
		  <br/><br/>-The game is very similar to the Super Mario Bros. (SMB) games. Peach has to go through a total of 8 worlds containing 7 levels each to find back her dear Mario.
		  <br/><br/>-You can run and jump, though other abilities are given to you through different costumes, such as the Fire Dress (gives your fireball throwing power), Tanooki Suit (allows you to fly for a short while) and Frog Bikini (allows more swimming control, but makes you hop outside water). There is also the Mushroom, that will give you a bracelet that protects you against one hit, but also increases breast size.
		  <br/><br/>-The biggest change that PUT has over SMB is of course the XXX scenes. Peach doesn't take damage from most of enemies, but instead she will be thrown into a given scene involving Goombas, Koopas, Shy Guys and many other different enemies and friends. Peach still loses a life if she falls into a pit or gets hit by other hazards such as fire bars.
		  <br/><br/>- The plan is to allow Peach to go through 8 worlds (plus a special world), with 7 levels each. The worlds (and their names as of yet):
			<br/><b>World 1</b> (Mushroom Kingdom): -> Boss: <b>Larry</b>
			<br/><b>World 2</b>(Desert): Dry Dry Desert -> Boss: <b>Morton</b>
			<br/><b>World 3</b> (Subcon - SMB2): Subcon Kingdom -> Boss: <b>Wendy</b>
			<br/><b>World 4</b> (Forest): Boggly Forest -> Boss: <b>Iggy</b>
			<br/><b>World 5</b> (Water): Delfino Beach -> Boss: <b>Lemmy</b>
			<br/><b>World 6</b> (Ice) : Flurry Hills -> Boss: <b>Roy</b>
			<br/><b>World 7</b> (Sky): Cuddle Clouds -> Boss: <b>Ludwig</b>
			<br/><b>World 8</b> (Dark Land): Bowser's Kingdom. -> Boss: <b>Bowser</b>
			<br/><b>The Moon (we can call World 9).</b> -> Boss: <b>Sir Grodus</b> (he's back!)
			<br/><br/>-Peach can also find a friend in each world. These are for instance Princess Daisy for Dry Dry Desert and King Osama from SMB2 (he has returned!).
			<br/><br/>-Peach's Castle acts as a HUB, where Peach can also find a marketplace later on, that sells items and costumes to Peach for money she finds inside stages. You will also find a bunker there where cannons are located. Each will bring Peach to [strike]ecstasy[/strike] a different world. The worlds come in order, so to go to World 3, Peach first needs to beat World 2., for instance.
			<br/><br/>-There will be E. Gadd, the inventor. He can ask Peach to find him pieces of a blueprint which you can find through levels. You can go to the special world after collecting them all. (There's also another perk but find that out yourself ;).)
			<br/><br/>-Peach can fill up the horny bar if she gets into a sex scene or if she masturbates (exact controls are still thought of). A (nearly) full horny bar will make enemies come after Peach more than normal. Decrease it by having sex or by masturbating more. It's a good idea to at least keep some of the bar filled as it will protect you against hits. Peach can also be dizzy (or drunk), making her walk wonkly.
			<br/>There is also the lactate button. Press this to make Peach lactate and lower her breast size. A bigger bust will make Peach walks slower and it will affect her buoyancy.
			<br/><br/>Each world will have an Airship level that will act as a boss area with koopalings as bosses. Peach will need to defeat them by stomping them or using fireballs or having sex with them.
			<br/>Before going to Airship, she will encounter a representative, a friend that's in peril. Peach may have to do some actions to reach the airship. Some scenes may occur.
			<br/><br/>Castle levels will have mini bosses, which will be Boom-booms or Birdos (the dragons), or other semi bosses, with different scenes. Peach will have to stomp/have sex in order to keep going. In the end of these castles, Peach frees some toads, which can request sex. In the future, Peach will be allowed to destroy the castle with dynamite.
			<br/><br/>Certain half bosses may appear in certain levels, like Birdos.
			<br/><br/>In the future, Peach will be able to kiss enemies in order to flee. This might only be possible if she is still not in contact with him (like when she is amazed, with her hand on her mouth, while goomba's dick gets aroused, for example). Upon kissing him, he will be stunned and Peach can be controlled. Also, its expected to have pregnancy in the game.
