			<b>-27th march 2017:</b> The game is back on to the first page of LOK site. My internet is back (it was off since a week ago) and my vacation ENDED. We may see many updates soon. BUT AEDLER SITE IF OFF until I fix it. I am sorry for the delay.
			<br /><b>-26th february 2017:</b> I'm on my vacation! I generally work more in the game during it, until 22th of march. I am creating level 8-2 and some features.
			<br /><b>-29th january 2017:</b> Bowser Castle level fully done! Many features like an elevator based on New Bowser Castle by Playshapes. Final scenes with Bowser and even Shadow Queen still to be finished by Blargh, though!
			<br /><b>-28th january 2017:</b> I've been offline for a week due to internet problems, but I am okay. It's rare to be away from LOK, but if this happens (provided I am not dead 
			<img src="https://html-online.com/editor/tinymce/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-innocent.gif" alt="innocent" />), I generally come back. Generally it can last up to 10 days for 2 or 3 times in the year. If more than 1 month, you can be worried a bit. If not, please have patience. Just be aware of this.
			<br /><b>-11th december 2016:</b> XML of Portuguese-BR language 100% complete! Fixed ShyGuy level BUG!
			<br /><b>-23th october 2016:</b> URGENT!! The game NOW supports ALL LATIN languages (with accents), Russian and certain countries like BieloRussia! (Cyrilic!) Except Greek (so far)
			<br /><b>-9th october 2016:</b> Huge XML process is COMPLETED! People who want to translate the game (as its now possible to load custom XML into it), please access my <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT" target="_blank">GITHUB!</a> 
			Be careful before just getting the XML or a given language and updating it because others can be doing the same! Avoid double work!
