		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">NEWS and GENERAL INFO:</span></h3>
			<b>-12th april 2017</b> : TF PEACH model (TripFlip HourGlass shaped Peach) complete (design phase)! Now its MY TIME to PUT her in the game. It might take a week or two. Also, Level 8-2 ALMOST done. Pointy (from Yoshi island) will also be on it. Revamped 'brown rock walls' from Biles! And a new Scene from Blargh (DoopLiss from Paper Mario2!) All of these to be uploaded soon!
			<br/><b>-1st april 2017</b> : New Aedler site (faster than aedler.com site), that has Issue Tracker support (you are accessing it right now) :D - thank you <b>OverLord</b>!) Also, Remember that, in order for me to fix a given bug quickly, just use DEBUG mode (PAGE DOWN key) before reproducing the bug and take a screen shot of the screen, THEN another screenshot of your OPTIONS screen. Better if recording a short video just before the bug happening, or a detailed description. Please register those info in the ISSUE link in the menu above! Thank you!
			<br/><b>-27th march 2017</b> : The game is back to LOK (still 3.29). My internet is back (it was off since a week ago) and  my vacation ENDED. We may see many updates soon. Aedler.com site is still OFF until I fix it.
			<br/><b>-26th february 2017:</b> I'm on my vacation! I generally work more in the game during it, until 22th of march. I am creating level 8-2 and some features.
			<br/><b>-29th january 2017:</b> Bowser Castle level fully done! Many features like an elevator based on New Bowser Castle by Playshapes. Final scenes with Bowser and even Shadow Queen still to be finished by Blargh, though!
			<br/><b>-28th january 2017:</b> I've been offline for a week due to internet problems, but I am okay. It's rare to be away from LOK, but if this happens (provided I am not dead 
			<img src="https://html-online.com/editor/tinymce/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-innocent.gif" alt="innocent" />), I generally come back. Generally it can last up to 10 days for 2 or 3 times in the year. If more than 1 month, you can be worried a bit. If not, please have patience. Just be aware of this.
			<br/><b>-11th december 2016:</b> XML of Portuguese-BR language 100% complete! Fixed ShyGuy level BUG!
			<br/><b>-23th october 2016:</b> URGENT!! The game NOW supports ALL LATIN languages (with accents), Russian and certain countries like BieloRussia! (Cyrilic!) Except Greek (so far)
			<br/><b>-9th october 2016:</b> Huge XML process is COMPLETED! People who want to translate the game (as its now possible to load custom XML into it), please access my <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT" target="_blank">GITHUB!</a> 
			Be careful before just getting the XML or a given language and updating it because others can be doing the same! Avoid double work!

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">LATEST CHANGELOGs:</span></h3>
			<b>Update 3.30 (1st April 2017) - IN PROGRESS</b>
			<br/>- Please reload an external XML (english or other) to refresh the language of the game! Use the ones in my GITHUB (https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT/). Or you can just click RESET SAVES in the first screen if you dont have saved games and you dont want to mess around the XML files (English only!)
			<br/>- NEW: Flurry scene 5 (By Blargh!) Its put in scene 4, so scene 5 will be the vaginal one (more time for Peach to remain virgin).
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Fire Peach with 'endless growing blue earrings' when taking a Fire Powerup while a normal Peach.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: BluePrint in 7-1 was impossible to take (a given pipe was not being accessible).
			<br/>- Rule Change: 'main cheat' activate key is now '1 and 0' instead of 1,9 and 0 pressed at the same time, due to some requests (people using certain keyboards and notebooks with problems like 3 or more keys pressed at the same time).
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Update 3.29 (3rd March 2017)</b>
			<br/>- NEW: Fire Peach PS character (due to some requests)!
			<br/>- NEW: OPTION: "Fire Peach if burned, back to Peach if lost". It will be ON as default. If 'Vanilla Peach' takes a Fire Flower powerup or if she is touched by a fire hazard/creature, she will be with a dark skin. She will be normal again if you take another powerup or lose a life. It will only work if you're using a 'Peach' character. You can disable this feature in the options screen (it will be saved in the cache for new games as well).
			<br/>- IMPROVED protection modes! Protection is the 'invulnerability time after being hit or a scene'. Now you can choose between 3,2,1 or 0 seconds! Beware that HARD GAME mode ignores this (Its always '0'!) Default: 3 seconds.
			<br/>- IMPROVED code of Character Select Screen (tech info: target button instead of older 'a listener for each button').
			<br/>- IMPROVED intro/prologue screens with NEW screens! Now, the first screen tells us that everything was in peace in the princess's castle, then it will show us that the current character (be it Peach, Daisy, Rosalina, etc) was playing with the toads (some in a lewd way), explaining why the innocent princess is already experiencing lascivous actions, then the train scene, and finally the drama of airships invading. Morever, even if you're playing as Daisy or Krystal, for example, the story will tell you were in castle with the toads, etc, as its supposed that each princess know Peach's castle already.
			<br/>- RULE CHANGED: now, all 4 toads will be seated in her royal table (in her castle level) in certain days (Day 5, Day 15...), alongside the current probability to appear in any other day (you can still see them seated there on day 2 and day 8, for example, although much rarer). Before this update, it was hard to get them all seated (probability < 5%).
			<br/>- RULE CHANGED: the princess wont be taken by a creature right after using the blue info/sound boxes. Some invulnerability will be applied for enough time to run away.
			<br/>- RULE CHANGED: When restarting the game, the train and bed scenes in the prologue will now make the princess wear (or not) the garter/stockings/gloves, etc, that was configured in her outfit screen for new powerups.
			<br/>- BUG FIX: Peach's Bath scenes (like in her castle) are now DISABLED until I fix it.
			<br/>- BUG FIX: Lakitu pole scene (when the princess touches the dildo) made her disappear. Tech Info: Argument error (this,0)
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: In the train scenes (like in the prologue and when you walk around in this level with Mario), the mountain were only moving once (then we werent seeing any mountain again). Also, the upper are of the train was blue instead of black (it was like the roof was absent or destroyed).
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: Certain powerups set with 'random outfit' (like Striker) was making other powerups like Fire Flower also be random.
			<br/>- Glitch Fix: wrong balloon text in the cumming action of 'curious restrain' scene (next to Leslie the swan) in her castle.

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">VOTING POLLS RESULTS:</span></h3>
			<b>31th:</b> Almost 60% wants Mona as the next character, while 21% Wants Pauline, and the rest dont matter. 
			<br/><b>30th:</b> Almost half of people prefer toads immediatelly fucking Peach if she is a nymph, horny or drunk, but more than the other half finds it annoying in varying degrees, so I added  'Toads Able to Fuck her immediatelly' (YES/NO) in the options.
			<br/><b>29th:</b> Almost 60% dont care about 'asshole' synonyms Peach can use, and 31% 'wants it!' A minority thinks names like 'Derriere mouth', for example, are ugly. However I will do my best to use sexy names.
			<br/><b>28th:</b> 33% wants more Boo, Flurries, Bumpties and Nibble scenes.  20% wants Ninji, Lakitu and Monty Mole scenes. 15% prefer me to keep my own pace (like making levels).
			<br/><b>27th:</b> Opinion of current gameplay: 50% say its on average (they dont want easier or harder right now). And 35% dont care about it.
			<br/><b>26th:</b> Peach Virginity with friends: more than 60% prefer friends fucking her and taking out her virginity in later scenes (like scene 5 or later). Players can load a saved game anyway.
			<br/><b>25th:</b> From more than 250 people, 63% want a small pinky-red blood splat if she loses virginity, as an ON/OFF option.
			<br/><b>24th:</b> From 130 people, almost 100 prefer CatSuit than Tigeress. I will ADD CatSuit due to this.
			<br/><b>23th:</b> People want me to choose with whom Peach will take a bath with, in her castle. Second place: Peach and Krystal. So I decided to let Peach bathe herself, with the possibility to (NEW!) go to Toadella's bath, in the lower floor (New Peach Castle). 
			<br/><b>22th:</b> People want the PENGUIN powerup and ICE FLOWER powerup for Peach. The second group wants just ICE FLOWER. As the Penguin has been made, Ice flower can be made after Biker outfit, when we have world 6.
			<br/><b>21th:</b> People prefer Toads appearing in the grey castles and in some prisons/restraining areas along the levels. They dont like Toads appearing on airships as hostages.
			<br/><b>20th:</b> More than 60% prefer Character Select screen ONCE in the start, then Peach would need to go to her bathroom/closet to use this screen to change clothes. Only clothes alike can be changed (e.g. 'Dress types', 'Swimsuit types' and 'Sport types'). Until then, we can choose which outfit Peach will be in new powerups, in the 'Outfit Room' screen, at any time.
			<br/><b>19th:</b> People prefer BELOME with<b> 2 eyes</b> only and fangs (<b>almost 50%</b>). Normal 4 eyes: <b>34%</b>. 2 eyes with no fangs: <b>15%</b>.
			<br/><b>18th:</b> They prefer BIGGEST Chain Chomps, then MIDDLE size ones. <i>80 vs 51</i>
			<br/><b>17th:</b> Most people don't care about how many water levels the game will have. Some prefer only 2 levels in the entire game.
			<br/><b>16th:</b> People DO want Pregnant Peach (as an optional feature).<i>108 vs 57</i>
			<br/><b>15th:</b> Next enemy to be designed: <b>NIPPLER PLANTS</b>. Then, <b>CHARGING CHUCKS</b>. Then, <b>BOWSER JR</b> (Ok done! But not in the game yet).
			<br/><b>14th:</b> Name of DESERT WORLD:<b>Dry Dry Desert!</b> All other names could be used as level names.
			<br/><b>13th:</b> People want <b>more sex scenes</b>. 2nd: they want <b>more ENEMY characters</b>. 3nd: they <b>prefer me to choose</b>. Thank you!
			<br/><b>12th:</b> RAWK HAWK will have legs. <i>63 vs 15</i>
			<br/><b>11th:</b> "FLURRY HILLS" Win! (name of World 6).
			<br/><b>10th:</b> Peach crouching while in backside pose (showing her butt and nice bits) WIN! <i>58 vs 19 vs14</i>
			<br/><b>9th:</b> Young Peach Model was chosen! 96 vs 53. However, as there is more than 25% wanting Playshapes Peach back, I've put her too.
			<br/><b>8th:</b> PLOT #3 (airships and Kamek with aphrodisiac curse) WIN.
			<br/><b>7th:</b> Game name changed to PUT: Peach's Untold Tale.
			<br/><b>6th:</b> "Peach should be free (traversing blocks) only if they're already used (becoming solid) or if a special one (e.g. straw blocks), like Super Mario Bros 2" WIN!</b> <i>56 vs 25!</i>
			<br/><b>5th:</b> People who want peeing ability to Peach (with buttons like use/dont use toilet) WIN! <i>145 vs 66!</i>
			<br/><b>4th:</b> People who prefer Peach losing clothing parts instead of the entire powerup when she's hurt WIN! <i>92 vs 16!</i> Peach will lose the powerup, being stark naked, ONLY if she's hit while using the last clothing part.
			<br/><b>3rd:</b> People who prefer levels NOT being restarted WIN! <i>54 vs 5!</i>From now on, when Peach dies, the level will NOT be restarted, but powerups will. 
			<br/><b>2nd:</b> People still prefer Control Key for Jump! But this poll was cancelled because it was too few votes and several bugs appeared due to this being a browser short key!
			<br/><b>1st: </b>Birdo model by BILES was chosen! 
			
		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">PUT CHEATS:</span></h3>
			<b>I hope you feel guilty!</b> But I understand if you use them sparingly because of a bug, for example.
			<br/>Bonuses will be disabled and coins/score points will be zero in each level! Let's go to the board! Click to enlarge.

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>. Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separatelly (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out 'KNOWN BUGS' section below before reporting.		
			<br/></br><b>I wont make:</b>
			  <br/>- Scat. I am not fond of these fetishes, but I do know people who likes it, and I dont care anyway, more because ON/OFF option was possible. However, too many people are against this at all costs, so it wont be coded in MIM PUT in any circunstances. Moreover, Peach is a 'clean' damsel, outside and inside (a perfect woman for ass lovers). However, a 'clean cum fart' (e.g. for her ass/pussy) is feasible.
			  <br/>- Theatre/Audience style 'fight' like Paper Mario 2: I wont make this system neither on PUT or in Cute Peach game. Fights will happen during normal level, right on the spot (scenes). But we could have creatures that can make a crowd there in certain circunstances. And we can have a theatre AREA with an audience but inside a given building, with some local fights there. Sorry about that but I dont like the threatre system in Paper Mario 2.
			  <br/>- Modern electronic objects found in real life, like palmtops, portable consoles, cameras for Lakitu and Wario, cars and motorcycles. This game follows a medieval theme, like Super Mario 1, 2, and Super Mario RPG. They can have classical/magical structures instead, like wooden binoculars and carriages. If modern karts/bikes are present, it should be explict they were E.Gadd or Sir Grodus technology. Sorry about that, I just dont agree of *everything* in a Mario game. The non linear way every Mario game has was the way Mario creators did to give fun for kids). 
			  <br/>- Certain Mario friends/enemies from newer games like New Super Mario Bros (U) and Super Paper Mario (mostly the unknown ones, not common in older series), and Waluigi (in the case I add Wario). So I wont be just adding friends/enemies until further discussion. People have really to convince me and better if you bring the model with some scenes already, like LuftMallow did with the Anuboo (the black dog from Super Star Saga). The exception is creatures from Paper Mario 2, because I based this game on it too.
			  <br/>- Non Mario Universe creatures like Donkey Kong, Zelda, Pokemon... The only exception is the DK himself ONLY in the case I add a Pauline scene, this being an Easter Egg.
			<br/><br/>Just to remember, I already discussed about these items during these forum pages.
