		<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Those are issues I am aware of. If they're here, that's due to the fact I am still trying to reproduce them, or it's just hard to be fixed.</span></h3>
		<p>- When we close the game without saving and then load the last save file we used, the progress we made with the levels is not saved (which is what is supposed to happen). HOWEVER, we find Peach in the same state (her dress, her belly status) and in the same spot on the world map that I left her in even if I didn't save.' Perhaps current_level and current_world aren't going to cache (ConfigSettings)? - CHECKING</p>
		<p>- Trying to reproduce: 'Sometimes (more when you go to it from panic mode) the screen 'descents', that is, the camera goes down (both 16:9 options are on)</p>
		<p>- Trying to reproduce: In Flash Player 17 (other player versions too ?!), when we go to the Bonus Toad House, the game crashes right when entering in the level or inside the smurf house. Sometimes she returns to Worldmap right away.</p>
		<p>- Trying to reproduce: Giving Mario the royal pussy for the first time makes Peach disappear.</p>
		<p>- Trying to reproduce: The princess kills creatures while in scene. It may happen if she is catched up when sliding down (butt-seated in the slopes).</p>
