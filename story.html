		<h3>Why 'Peach Untold Tale':</h3>
		<p>In one day of April 2011, I was searching for hentai games on swfchan, when I found M&iacute;M from Playshapes. I decided to play it. I loved that game in a way I couldn't explain. 
		Playshapes became my fan. The game starts in the marvelous world of Mushroom Kingdom, where Peach wakes up inside her castle without clothes and missing Mario, while her bed is filled with cum. 
		There, the chancellor told her the only way to save the kingdom is fucking enemies, while she was giving a blowjob to his poor old dick as a 'breakfast', being embarrassed. Then she started her adventure, without 
		really knowing how to do it, while the nostalgic medieval song was playing tenderly. This gave me enchantement. 
		<br /><br />But a lot of things were still missing (not only Mario). And the game code was already hard 
		to follow and program. Where to start? I decided to throw in new ideas (Peach AE version, now called 'PUT'), getting inspirations from tons of free hentai pictures, three other Peach parodies (one from Japan), and a base 
		code from PlayShapes and Blargh. A game focused on ENF (embarrassed nude female), with some exhibitionism, and a more non linear feeling, featuring Peach only as the playable character (like 'Princess Peach for DS'). PS: 
		Daisy and Rosalina now playable, anyway the main objective now is centralized on Peach. 
		<br /><br />Also, the game envisioned includes adventure and RPG styles, like interation with Peach friends and others known characters of Mario's games.
		
		<br />(There will be other possibilites in the game, like fetish/futa/tentacle/pee/pregnant possibilities, all with ON/OFF options for those who never wants that with our cute damsel).
		<br /><br />In 26 april 2012, thus 1 year later, I was in a dark age, learning game programming from scratch. Nobody helped me aside of Blargh and HumminBird0 (although more than 95% of the code was made by my efforts). 
		I was not a hard coder neither an animator, much less a graphic designer, but once with ideas, I told myself :'challenge accepted!' Goal: a true XXX Mario game with one of the most cute ladies: Princess Peach. 
		<br /><br />My initial intention was to add some features like breaking blocks, 2 new poses like Peach Frontside and Backside, some sex scenes and World1 finished with 6 levels, and 5 outfits, using Blargh's version. 
		But the game bursted with new features a way beyond that, with more than 60 new poses/actions, a Peach that is almost 3D (we can see all of her perspectives), more than 300 UNICQUE sex scenes, 25 outfits, 
		almost 8 full worlds (more than 68 levels), Peach Campus area with some small levels, tons of dialogues with creatures and objects, an inventory (like SMB3) and more. 
		<br /><br />The project has NO deadlines. This opens many possibilities and frees myself of strict timelines, in order to make more coding/efforts, and creativity flows better. This game could have 100 levels 
		or 'just' 70, and even more sex scenes, like 500 (!!), depending on her situation. It will depend on the efforts and feedbacks of this development, and donations, a thing that doesn't hurt and will make me work in the game even more. 
		<br /><br />A thing is sure, I'm engaged on that because I really want to see it as a full parody game in order to let us, adults, still dream, while in our strict leisure time due to our daily work, defending PEACE (PEACH!), 
		not WAR, and remembering the old times when we played videogames. I'm a former gamer after all. I've spent dozens of dollars in the past with cartridges and hours playing games like Super Mario 1,2,3, Paper Mario 2, 
		and Super Mario RPG in order to know this marvelous world better. Playing games will make me design better parodies. As a last side-note, incredible enough, I was a former Sonic fan, until knowing Mario games better. 
		Then I prefered Peach than Amy and even other women in games <img title="Wink" src="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" />
		<br /><br />This project has inner concepts from Playshapes and me already. Its expected that every developer has his/her goals. I've reached this far because I've made some inner dreams true and implemented. 
		There are ideas/features I really wanted in the game. But there are things that can be improved. If a good meeting/discussion changes my mind, I can improve a given idea I've had before, in order to make the game 
		experience better. You have to convince me. And the new feature(s) must be inside Mario Universe (but a bit of 'sauce' or 'side story' , e.g. Krystal appearance and some new dress outfits for Peach - provided its not 
		aside of medieval world /fairy land - should be tolerated). And I use to add features, not replace them. Thats why I add 'ON/OFF' options.
		<br /><br />PUT was firstly coded in AS2. Its now in AS3!</p>
